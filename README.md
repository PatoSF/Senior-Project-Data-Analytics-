# Senior-Project-Data-Analytics-
This project demonstrates the causes and consequences of air pollution and global warming using various Tableau charts.
After gaining numerous skills in Data Analytics, I chose to start my first professional Data Analytics Project on Air Pollution and Global Warming. This topic should be discussed more regularly, and humanity should work together to solve these issues. It's a significant and fascinating issue that should be handled seriously. I hope you appreciate my findings.

Here are some of the skills acquired:
1- Ask the proper questions to acquire the whole picture and comprehend all of the requirements for a successful solution.
2- Prepare the data I'll need to conduct a comprehensive and accurate analysis.
3- Ability to go through various types of data from open to public data, qualitative to quantitative... and process the data by cleaning it and removing any potential biases.
4- Analyze the data using various charts to help showcase my study to stakeholders and communicate the right message as simply as possible.
5- Share my findings to stakeholders so that they can make data driven decisions and solve the current problem.
6- It's pointless to do the analysis if we don't act on it. The final step is the most crucial of all. That's where we make things happen.

Software used:
-Tableau
-Excel
-PostgreSQL
-Python

There is a Tableau file in the Senior Project folder; please download it to your PC and download all of the excel sheets in the Data folder.
After running the Tableau file, check for any location or connection problems.
The file pollution_us_2000_2016_ in the folder data is an excel binary workbook. I couldn't upload it because it was more than 25mb so please save it as a normal excel workbook in the folder data, delete the previous one and connect the normal excel workbook to Tableau to fix the problem.

PS: The pictures of the charts are in the Pictures folder.
