This project demonstrates the causes and consequences of air pollution and global warming using various Tableau charts.

After gaining numerous skills in Data Analytics, I chose to start my first professional Data Analytics Project.
Here are some of the skills:
1- Ask the proper questions to acquire the whole picture and comprehend all of the requirements for a successful solution.
2- Prepare the data I'll need to conduct a comprehensive and accurate analysis.
3- Ability to go through various types of data from open to public data, qualitative to quantitative... and process the data by cleaning it and removing any potential biases.
4- Analyze the data using various charts to help showcase my study to stakeholders and communicate the right message as simply as possible.
5- Share my findings to stakeholders so that they can make data driven decisions and solve the current problem.
6- It's pointless to do the analysis if we don't act on it. The final step is the most crucial of all. That's where we make things happen.
